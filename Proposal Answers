## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO 

A game that allows you to put dress up a Barbie with different clothing.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO

The software will implement files of drawings of articles of clothings. Users will be able to drag these articles of clothing onto a Barbie, so that they can have fun and dress her up however they want.
The coding will be a mix of artistry and coding, as it requires me to draw the articles of clothing by hand, and code what is necessary to drag and put the clothing onto the Barbie.
